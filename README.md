# Vehicle Detection

---

**Vehicle Detection Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

#### 1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.

I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  Sample images of cars and noncars dataset are below:

The code for the HOG step is contained in the 5th code cell of the IPython notebook. 

I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

Here is an example using the `YUV` color space and HOG parameters:
  * color_space = 'YUV'
  * spatial_size=(32, 32)
  * hist_bins=32
  * orient = 11
  * pix_per_cell = 16
  * cell_per_block = 2
  * hog_channel='ALL'

#### 2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.

I settled on my final choice of HOG parameters based upon the performance of the SVM classifier produced using them. I considered not only the accuracy with which the classifier made predictions on the test dataset, but also the speed at which the classifier is able to make predictions. There is a balance to be struck between accuracy and speed of the classifier, and my strategy was to bias toward speed first, and achieve as close to real-time predictions as possible, and then pursue accuracy if the detection pipeline were not to perform satisfactorily.

The final parameters chosen were those labeled "configuration 24" in the table above: YUV colorspace, 11 orientations, 16 pixels per cell, 2 cells per block, and ALL channels of the colorspace. The classifier performance of each of the configurations from the table above are summarized in the table below:



#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).
In the section titled "Train a Classifier" I trained a linear SVM with the default classifier parameters and using HOG features alone (I did not use spatial intensity or channel intensity histogram features) and was able to achieve a test accuracy of 98.17%.

### Sliding Window Search

#### 1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

In the section titled "Method for Using Classifier to Detect Cars in an Image" I adapted the method find_cars from the lesson materials. The method combines HOG feature extraction with a sliding window search, but rather than perform feature extraction on each window individually which can be time consuming, the HOG features are extracted for the entire image (or a selected portion of it) and then these full-image features are subsampled according to the size of the window and then fed to the classifier. The method performs the classifier prediction on the HOG features for each window region and returns a list of rectangle objects corresponding to the windows that generated a positive ("car") prediction.

The image below shows the first attempt at using find_cars on one of the test images, using a single window size:

I explored several configurations of window sizes and positions, with various overlaps in the X and Y directions. The following four images show the configurations of all search windows in the final implementation, for small (1x), medium (1.5x, 2x), and large (3x) windows:

Because a true positive is typically accompanied by several positive detections, while false positives are typically accompanied by only one or two detections, a combined heatmap and threshold is used to differentiate the two. The add_heat function increments the pixel value (referred to as "heat") of an all-black image the size of the original image at the location of each detection rectangle. Areas encompassed by more overlapping rectangles are assigned higher levels of heat. The following image is the resulting heatmap from the detections in the image above:

A threshold is applied to the heatmap (in this example, with a value of 1), setting all pixels that don't exceed the threshold to zero. The result is below:

The scipy.ndimage.measurements.label() function collects spatially contiguous areas of the heatmap and assigns each a label:

And the final detection area is set to the extremities of each identified label:

#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

Ultimately I searched on two scales using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:

The final implementation performs very well, identifying the near-field vehicles in each of the images with no false positives.

The first implementation did not perform as well, so I began by optimizing the SVM classifier. The original classifier used HOG features from the YUV Y channel only, and achieved a test accuracy of 96.28%. Using all three YUV channels increased the accuracy to 98.40%, but also tripled the execution time. However, changing the pixels_per_cell parameter from 8 to 16 produced a roughly ten-fold increase in execution speed with minimal cost to accuracy.

Other optimization techniques included changes to window sizing and overlap as described above, and lowering the heatmap threshold to improve accuracy of the detection (higher threshold values tended to underestimate the size of the vehicle).
### Video Implementation

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)
Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)


#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

The code for processing frames of video is contained in the cell titled "Pipeline for Processing Video Frames" and is identical to the code for processing a single image described above, with the exception of storing the detections (returned by find_cars) from the previous 15 frames of video using the prev_rects parameter from a class called Vehicle_Detect. Rather than performing the heatmap/threshold/label steps for the current frame's detections, the detections for the past 15 frames are combined and added to the heatmap and the threshold for the heatmap is set to 1 + len(det.prev_rects)//2 (one more than half the number of rectangle sets contained in the history) - this value was found to perform best empirically (rather than using a single scalar, or the full number of rectangle sets in the history).

I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  

Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:

### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

The problems that I faced while implementing this project were mainly concerned with detection accuracy. Balancing the accuracy of the classifier with execution speed was crucial. Scanning 190 windows using a classifier that achieves 98% accuracy should result in around 4 misidentified windows per frame. Of course, integrating detections from previous frames mitigates the effect of the misclassifications, but it also introduces another problem: vehicles that significantly change position from one frame to the next (e.g. oncoming traffic) will tend to escape being labeled. Producing a very high accuracy classifier and maximizing window overlap might improve the per-frame accuracy to the point that integrating detections from previous frames is unnecessary (and oncoming traffic is correctly labeled), but it would also be far from real-time without massive processing power.

The pipeline is probably most likely to fail in cases where vehicles (or the HOG features thereof) don't resemble those in the training dataset, but lighting and environmental conditions might also play a role (e.g. a white car against a white background). As stated above, oncoming cars are an issue, as well as distant cars (as mentioned earlier, smaller window scales tended to produce more false positives, but they also did not often correctly label the smaller, distant cars).

I believe that the best approach, given plenty of time to pursue it, would be to combine a very high accuracy classifier with high overlap in the search windows. The execution cost could be offset with more intelligent tracking strategies, such as:

determine vehicle location and speed to predict its location in subsequent frames
begin with expected vehicle locations and nearest (largest scale) search areas, and preclude overlap and redundant detections from smaller scale search areas to speed up execution
use a convolutional neural network, to preclude the sliding window search altogether
